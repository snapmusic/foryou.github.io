Welcome to the "4U - Privacy Photo Album 4U - 隐私相册" application! We take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following Privacy Policy carefully before using this application to understand how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.

Information Collection and Use

Our application does not collect or store your photo album access permissions or photo album content. We only request write access to your photo album so that you can import photos and files into the privacy photo album.
Our application uses wallpaper mode as the default disguise to protect your privacy. You can set a disguise password to enhance privacy security further.
Our application supports capturing and saving live photos but does not access or share these live photos.
Our application supports the import of photos and files but does not access or share the imported content.
Automatic Protection Mode

When using the privacy photo album, any actions that take the application to the background will automatically reset it to wallpaper mode, ensuring effective protection against potential privacy leaks.
Cloud Backup and Media Encryption

Our application does not perform any cloud backups, ensuring that your photos and videos stay within local storage.
We believe that your phone's password is already strong enough, and therefore, there is no need for additional media encryption technology. The privacy photo album aims to provide simple yet effective privacy protection, particularly suitable for safeguarding against familiar individuals.
